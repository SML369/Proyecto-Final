# Telecommunications Company Analysis
The project involved analyzing a dataset from CallMeMaybe, a customer service and call management company, to provide supervisors with insights on the least effective operators. An operator was considered ineffective if they had a high number of missed inbound calls (both internal and external) and long wait times for incoming calls. Additionally, if an operator was expected to make outbound calls, a low volume of such calls was also considered a sign of inefficiency.
